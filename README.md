# SAFE Team App ‚Äì CEN 4020 Project

This is a campus safety ride request app designed for students at the **University of South Florida**.  
It works like Uber, but it‚Äôs restricted to USF students and only works within the campus area.

This project was built as part of the **CEN 4020 ‚Äì Software Engineering** course, where we worked as a team to design, document, and develop a real-world application from scratch.

### üì± What It Does

- Lets USF students request a ride on campus from SAFE Team
- Matches students with available SAFE drivers
- Focuses on student safety, simplicity, and campus-only usage

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Frontend: (your tech stack here ‚Äì e.g., React Native, Flutter, etc.)
- Backend: (e.g., Node.js, Firebase, etc.)
- Database: (e.g., Firestore, MySQL, etc.)

### üß† What I Learned

- Working in a real agile team environment
- Planning out features and responsibilities
- Writing use cases, user stories, and test cases
- Building a full app from concept to working prototype
